# Bioinformatics Learning Resources 🌠

Here, I will be sharing resources 📚 that I have used and still use for learning 📝 different bioinformatic methods as well as other supplementary material that are needed to understand and apply these methods in real world data analyses 💻.

## NGS Data Analysis
- (SequencEnG)[https://education.knoweng.org/sequenceng/] - An interactive learning resource for next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. It provides detailed NGS Analysis Workflows.
