# Bioinformatics Learning Resources 🌠

Here, I will be sharing resources 📚 that I have used and still use for learning 📝 different bioinformatic methods as well as other supplementary material that are needed to understand and apply them in real world data analyses 💻.

## NGS Data Analysis
- [SequencEnG](https://education.knoweng.org/sequenceng/) - An interactive learning resource for next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. It provides detailed NGS Analysis Workflows.
- [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Training Courses](https://www.sib.swiss/training/upcoming-training-courses) - A great resource that offers free course material on different bioinformatics topics. The materials made available are from the courses that are conducted by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.
